			<header>About the game</header>
			Global Game Jam 2014's theme was <blockquote>We don't see things as
			they are, we see them as we are.</blockquote>The theme reminded
			me of Maslow's hammer, <blockquote>I suppose it is tempting, if the
			only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a
			nail.</blockquote>I set out to make a game where the player is given
			several tools, and will be forced not to rely on one of them.

			In this game, you will use three different attacks to defend
			yourself from approaching enemies.
			<ul>
				<li>You can click on enemies to destroy them</li>
				<li>You can type the labels on enemies to destroy them</li>
				<li>You can use the joystick (or arrow keys) to fire a very
				large beam and destroy them</li>
			</ul>
			But beware, as if you continue to use the same weapon, it becomes
			less effective.
			<ul>
				<li>If you keep clicking enemies, future enemies will be
				smaller</li>
				<li>If you keep typing enemy labels, future enemies will have
				longer words</li>
				<li>If you keep using the beam weapon, future enemies will be
				more spread out, and the beam will be narrower</li>
			</ul>

				<li>Use your keyboard to type enemy labels. Use enter or space
				to fire.</li>

				button to fire. Or, use left and right arrow keys to aim your
				ship, and press up to fire.</li>

			There are five HUD elements.
			<ul>
				<li>The input field at the bottom of the screen is where you
				type. You shouldn't have to click it, clicking on the game will
				re-focus the input</li>
				<li>The meter on the left side of the screen is the blaster
				challenge meter. As it increases, enemies are more spread out,
				and the blaster is less powerful.</li>
				<li>The meter on the right is the mouse challenge meter. As it
				increases, the enemies get smaller, and move more radially.</li>
				<li>The meter on the bottom is the typing challenge meter. As it
				increases, the words you need to type become longer.</li>
				<li>The number at the top is your score.</li>
			</ul>
