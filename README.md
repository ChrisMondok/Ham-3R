Ham-3R
======

Game by Chris Mondok

Audio by Matt Strawder

Hosting
-------
You can either host the 'client' folder using pretty much any web server, or use
the included node server. The node server is required if you want joystick input
(which only works on linux).

Notes
-----
- If you use node to host the game, all clients will use the same joystick.
- Sounds don't play in Opera
- Everything looks wrong, and scores don't work in Firefox.
